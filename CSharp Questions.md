# CSharp Questions

1. Q: What is a namespace?
 
 A namespace is used to organize classes in C#
2. Q: What are value types?

	They are variables that can be assinged a value!
3. Q: What are reference types?


	It is a type of data that refers to an object in memory.
4. Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?

	They are properties that makes property declaration concise and functional without the use of any additional logic.
5. Q: What is the purpose of using statement?


	This statement is used for objects with short lifespans that happen to be within the block.


6. Q: What are dynamic type variables?


	An element typed as dynamic supports any operation and operates like is has a type of object.
7. Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?

	This ised used to compare to objects of possibly different types.
8. Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?

	
9. Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?


	These are used to allow a member to be accepted by outside classes.
10. Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

	Yeah, printf(""); is like this. You can print sentences and phrases, and you can also pass different arguments through it. 
11. Q: How do you sort an array?


	There is a method that takes 4 integers. Then it sorts them in place by using the Array.Sory overload.
12. Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

	A nullable type is used when to store any value as well as NULL. It can be used in databases where values are allowed to be undefined or missing at the time, this is where the NULL value can come into play.
13. Q: What is an enumeration?

	It is a tool you can use to define a set number of integral constants, allowing you to assign these to a variable.
14. Q: What is inheritance?

	When you create a new class that inherits or holds the attributes from an existing class.
15. Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?

	Multiple Inheritance is not supported in C#.
16. Q: What is the purpose of as operator?

	The "as" operator is like a less specified version of "is". You use it to compare reference types to one another.
17. Q: What is an object?

	It's block in a class were you can assign any data type to this.
18. Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?

	A structure can't inherit anything and is also a value type where as a class in a reference type.
19. Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?

	By using a break statement, you break out of the loop. If you use a continue statement, you are only skipping over one iteration and then continuing.
20. Q: What is this and how is it used?

	This keyword refers to the current class instance. It can used for multiple reasons, including declaring indexers, passing an object as a parameter to other methods.
21. Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?

	They are keywords in c# that are used to find exceptions and corrects them.
22. Q: How is exception handling done?

	An exception is a flag that is thrown up during code execution. We use a try block to partition code that might be affected by an exeption.
23. Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?

	You can use it to clean up any resource that was left allocated in a try block. Finally is mainly used after the control leaves the try statement.
24. Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

	An array list can have a variable length, where an array has a set length to it.
25. Q: What is an object?

	It's block in a class were you can assign any data type to this.

26. Q: Define constructor.

	Constructors usually initialize the data members of the object that was just created.
27. Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?

	The type is determined by the user. Var is used when var support is needed.
28. Q: What is an abstract class?

	They are prepared with the purpose to have the child class provide implementation, while the parent class is empty.
29. Q: What is an interface?

	An interface is a group of definitions of functionalities that can be implemented by different classes. 
30. Q: What is a method?

	This is where code blocks are built and executed.
31. Q: What is a property?

	They are members of classes, structures, and interfaces that are named.
32. Q: What is an access specifier?

	It defines the scope of an object. It could be private, public, protected, etc,.
33. Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?

	Public: It can be accessed from anywhere.
	private: only accessible within the classes or struct.
	protected:Limited within the struct or class and the inherited class.
	internal:Can access within a program that has the same declarations. It cannot access from any other assembly that isn't its own.
34. Q: What is a collection?

	A collection are classes that are useed for data storage and retrieval. They create collections of objects.
35. Q: What is a Hash Table?

	A system that uses key-and-value pairs that are organized based on their hash code.This is mainly used when you want to identify a useful key value.
